Every game object can has set of 3 textures:
    diffuse(base color)
    specular
    normal map

Prefer use diffuse texture in .png format if you need Alpha channel for transparency.
If not use .jpg.
Rest of textures use in .jpg format because it is less size.

FBX format exported from blender can store diffuse + specular + normal map textures.
