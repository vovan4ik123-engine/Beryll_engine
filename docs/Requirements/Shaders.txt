Name of MVP matrix in shader must be MVP_matrix
    uniform mat4 MVP_matrix;

Shader can contain two sampler2D for textures. Order of them is important.
    First sampler2D should be for diffuse texture and must has name diffuseTexture
        uniform sampler2D diffuseTexture;
    Second sampler2D should be for specular texture(if exist) and must has name specularTexture
        uniform sampler2D specularTexture;

Vertex shader example:
    #version 300 es

    precision highp float; // highp mediump lowp

    layout(location = 0) in vec3 inPosition;
    layout(location = 1) in vec3 inNormal;
    layout(location = 2) in vec2 inTextureCoords;

    out vec2 textureCoords;

    uniform mat4 MVP_matrix;

    void main()
    {
        textureCoords = inTextureCoords;

        gl_Position = MVP_matrix * vec4(inPosition, 1.0);
    }

Fragment shader example:
    #version 300 es

    precision highp float; // highp mediump lowp

    in vec2 textureCoords;

    out vec4 outColor;

    uniform sampler2D diffuseTexture;   // first in shader !!!
    uniform sampler2D specularTexture;  // second in shader !!!

    void main()
    {
        outColor = texture(diffuseTexture, textureCoords);
    }
