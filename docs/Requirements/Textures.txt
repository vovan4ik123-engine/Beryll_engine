Every game object can has set of 4 textures:
    diffuse(base color)
    specular
    normal map
    height map

Prefer use diffuse texture in .png format because Alpha channel.
If you need pass transparency to shader pass it in Alpha chanel of .png texture
Rest textures use in .jpg format because it is less size

FBX format exported from blender can store diffuse + specular + normal map textures,
height map is ignored oO.
You should load and bind height map manually before draw object which needs it.
