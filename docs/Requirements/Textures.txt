Every texture must be 24 or 32 bit depth.

Every game object can has set of 4 textures:
    diffuse(base color)
    specular
    normal map
    height map

Prefer use diffuse texture in .png format because Alpha channel.
If you need pass transparency to shader pass it in Alpha chanel of .png texture
Rest textures use in .jpg format because it is less size
