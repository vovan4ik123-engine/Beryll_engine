   Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 1 (SEGV_MAPERR), fault addr 0x0 in tid 24484 (SDLThread), pid 24372 (SDLActivity)
   SIGSEGV means a signal for memory access violation, trying to read or write memory area that your process does not have access.

   For example dereference nullptr or write to out fo range memory, or to not allocated memory.
