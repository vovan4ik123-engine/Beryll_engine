dynamic collision shapes by performance:
    200 items collision Convex  300 ms
    200 items collision Box     180 ms
    200 items collision Sphere  140 ms
    200 items collision Capsule 180 ms

release performance scene:
    0 objects:              8ms
    player capsule:         1ms
    simple animated man:    1.4ms
    multithreading:
        150 static vertices + player capsule: 1ms
        40k static vertices + player capsule: 6ms
        every +10k colliding ground vertices to scene = +0.875ms to frame time
